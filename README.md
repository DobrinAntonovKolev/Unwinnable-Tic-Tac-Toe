# Unwinnable-Tic-Tac-Toe
A Python practice project which allows a user to play an unwinnable Tic-Tac-Toe game against the program using console.

The user is unable to win because the program's logic selects the best possible move.

The point of this was to practice the python language, as well as improve as a programmer by pushing myself to solve a complicated problem like having the AI always select the best move that at worst forces a draw.
